# GYA-Discord-Client

This is a very simple terminal discord client made as a graduation project. It imlements Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt dms but this is a very tacky feature that was only added on so that i could use the already existing code base as a project and therefore graduate without too much hassle.

# Things you might learn
Some things that were hard for me when i orignally wrote this awful code is:
  1: running a curses frontend and discord bot at the same time.
  2: how to run a self bot. (discord will ban you and many alts were used in the trial and error process of this project.
  3: how NOT to plan a big project. 

# Updates as of 2022-05-09:
As of 2022-05-09 I have decided to to some spring cleaning around the repository so that it (while still suffering the architectural decisions of a somewhat overeager and unexperienced developer) atleast might make sense to a person reading it besides me.
This will be accomplished through:
* Adding more comments
* Using better variable names 
* Rewriting some select things
