# GYA-Discord-Client

This is a very simple terminal discord client made as a graduation project. It imlements Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt dms but this is a very tacky feature that was only added on so that i could use the already existing code base as a project and therefore graduate ez.

# Things you might learn
Some things that were hard for me when i orignally wrote this awful code is:
  1: running a curses frontend and discord bot at the same time (fuck threads man).
  2: how to run a self bot. (discord will ban you and many alts were used in the trial and error process of this project.
  3: how NOT to plan a big project.
